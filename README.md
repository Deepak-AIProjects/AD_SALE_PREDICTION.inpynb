#Purpose:
Ad sales prediction with AI is about estimating the future success of advertising campaigns using historical and contextual data.
1.Focus on Features:
The model learns from campaign characteristics like budget allocation, chosen advertising channels (e.g., digital, TV, print), audience demographics (age, location, interests), and performance indicators (like engagement or conversion rates).

2.Pattern Recognition:
By studying these features, the AI detects patterns that show which types of campaigns are more likely to succeed.

3.Business Benefits:
The insights help businesses optimize marketing strategies, better allocate resources, and improve ad targeting without needing exact financial predictions during training.

4.Overall Goal:
The ultimate aim is to enable smarter, data-driven decision-making that enhances campaign performance and efficiency.
